IMMEDIATE MVP TASK DISTRIBUTION:

CoverageHunter - Quick Wins (5-10 min each):
- test_gap_bridge_registry.py (44% ‚Üí 95% coverage)
- test_gap_command_handlers.py (untested methods)
- test_gap_argument_parser.py (all command paths)

CriticalPathTester - Business Logic (10-15 min each):
- test_critical_auth_flow.py (security paths)
- test_critical_data_validation.py (input sanitization)
- test_critical_orchestration.py (coordination logic)

EdgeCaseMaster - Corner Cases (5-10 min each):
- test_edge_empty_inputs.py (null/undefined handling)
- test_edge_concurrent_access.py (race conditions)
- test_edge_resource_limits.py (memory/timeout)

# 3. ORCHESTRATOR ENHANCEMENT - Better coordination

ENHANCED PARALLEL COORDINATION:

1. FILE ISOLATION PROTOCOL:
   - Each agent writes to SEPARATE test directories
   - No file conflicts, no locking issues
   - Merge coverage reports at the end

2. SMART TASK DISTRIBUTION:
   send-claude-message.sh parallel-test-coverage:0.1 "Hunter, create tests/coverage_gaps/test_gap_registry.py for bridge_registry.py"
   send-claude-message.sh parallel-test-coverage:0.2 "Critical, create tests/critical_paths/test_critical_auth.py for authentication"
   send-claude-message.sh parallel-test-coverage:0.3 "Edge, create tests/edge_cases/test_edge_null.py for null handling"

3. PROGRESS MONITORING:
   # Check all agents simultaneously
   for pane in 0.1 0.2 0.3; do
     echo "=== Agent $pane ===" 
     tmux capture-pane -t parallel-test-coverage:$pane -p | tail -5

4. COVERAGE MERGE COMMAND:
   coverage combine .coverage.hunter .coverage.critical .coverage.edge
   coverage report --fail-under=95

# 4. CONFLICT PREVENTION - No git collisions

GIT CONFLICT PREVENTION:

1. NO PARALLEL COMMITS - Orchestrator handles git at the end
2. Each agent works in separate test directories
3. Single batch commit after all tests complete
4. Example workflow:
   - Agents create tests (parallel)
   - Orchestrator reviews (sequential)
   - Orchestrator commits (single operation)

# 6. IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

SHIP IN 15 MINUTES:

1. Create test directories (30 seconds):
   mkdir -p tests/{coverage_gaps,critical_paths,edge_cases}

2. Start parallel team (1 minute):
   ./create_parallel_test_coverage_team.py --session mvp-tests

3. Distribute initial tasks (30 seconds):
   - Send file-isolated assignments to each agent
   - Each works on different module/directory

4. Monitor progress (continuous):
   watch 'for p in 0.1 0.2 0.3; do tmux capture-pane -t mvp-tests:$p -p | tail -3; done'

5. Merge coverage (1 minute):
   coverage combine .coverage.*
   coverage html
   open htmlcov/index.html

EXPECTED RESULT: 95% coverage in 15 minutes vs 45 minutes sequential
