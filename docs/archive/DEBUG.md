# ai-bridge Tool Diagnostic Report - Test Coverage Session

## Issue Summary
The ai-bridge tool is failing to communicate with ai-team-2 due to a missing dependency script during test coverage coordination.

## Technical Details

### Error Message
```
/Users/d0b01r1/.local/bin/ai-bridge: line 78: /Users/d0b01r1/.local/bin/send-to-peer.sh: No such file or directory
```

### File Status Check
- **ai-bridge script**: ✅ EXISTS at `/Users/d0b01r1/.local/bin/ai-bridge`
  - Permissions: `-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 d0b01r1 staff 3248 Aug 18 00:52`
  - Executable: ✅ YES
  - Size: 3248 bytes

- **send-to-peer.sh script**: ❌ MISSING at `/Users/d0b01r1/.local/bin/send-to-peer.sh`
  - Status: File does not exist
  - This is the dependency causing the failure at line 78

## Root Cause
The ai-bridge tool expects a `send-to-peer.sh` script at line 78 of its execution, but this script is missing from the expected location `/Users/d0b01r1/.local/bin/send-to-peer.sh`.

## Impact on Test Coverage Mission
- Cannot communicate with ai-team-2 for coordinated test coverage work
- Bridge functionality is completely broken
- Team coordination is limited to single ai-team agents only
- Must rely on internal team messaging via `send-claude-message.sh`

## Context: Test Coverage Session
This diagnostic occurred during active coordination of:
- Alex: Writing component rendering tests for modals
- Morgan: Improving AssociateExpHubScreen from 89.23% to 100% coverage  
- Sam: Executing integration testing cleanup plan
- Need for ai-team-2 assistance with additional test coverage work

## Previous Bridge Issues (Historical Context)
Prior debug session revealed mixed Python/Bash execution issues, but this appears to be a different missing dependency problem.

## Recommended Fix
1. Create the missing `send-to-peer.sh` script at `/Users/d0b01r1/.local/bin/send-to-peer.sh`
2. Or update the ai-bridge tool to handle the missing dependency gracefully
3. Or implement alternative communication method for ai-team-2 coordination

## Current Workaround
Continue using internal team messaging with `send-claude-message.sh` and coordinate test coverage work through single ai-team orchestration.
