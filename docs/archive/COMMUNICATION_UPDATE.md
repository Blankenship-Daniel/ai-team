# ✅ Communication Timing Update

## 🔧 Improved Message Delivery

The `send-claude-message.sh` script has been updated with better timing for more reliable communication with Claude agents.

## 📋 What Changed

### **Before:**
```bash
# Send message immediately
tmux send-keys -t "$WINDOW" "$MESSAGE"
sleep 0.5  # Short delay
tmux send-keys -t "$WINDOW" Enter
```

### **After:**
```bash
# Send message
tmux send-keys -t "$WINDOW" "$MESSAGE"
sleep 1    # 1-second delay for reliable typing
tmux send-keys -t "$WINDOW" Enter
```

## 🎯 Why This Matters

### **Reliable Message Delivery**
- Ensures prompts are fully typed before submission
- Prevents truncated messages due to timing issues
- More consistent communication with Claude agents

### **Better User Experience**
- Messages are delivered completely and reliably
- Reduces failed communications
- Agents receive full context every time

## 🚀 Usage (No Changes Required)

The commands remain exactly the same:

```bash
# Message Alex
send-claude-message.sh ai-team:0.1 "What's your take on this architecture?"

# Message Morgan
send-claude-message.sh ai-team:0.2 "How would you implement this quickly?"
```

## ⏱️ Timing Details

- **Message typing**: Instant
- **Processing delay**: 1 second
- **Enter submission**: Instant
- **Total time**: ~1 second per message

## 🔄 Automatic Update

This improvement is automatically included when you:
- Run `./install.sh` again
- The updated script is deployed to `~/.local/bin`
- All future AI team communications use the improved timing

## ✅ Benefits

1. **More reliable**: Messages are delivered completely
2. **Better debugging**: Easier to see what was sent
3. **Consistent timing**: Predictable 1-second delay
4. **Agent-friendly**: Gives Claude time to process the full prompt
