# v1.1 Context Manager Consolidation - COMPLETE ✅

## Consolidation Summary

### Phase 1: Deletion (COMPLETE)
- ❌ **DELETED:** `context_manager.py` (340 lines)
- ❌ **DELETED:** `agent_context_manager.py` (397 lines)
- **Total Debt Eliminated:** 737 lines

### Phase 2: Unification (COMPLETE)
- ✅ UnifiedContextManager is now the ONLY context manager
- ✅ All imports updated in:
  - `team_orchestration_manager.py`
  - `auto_context_keeper.py`

### Phase 3: Protocol Compliance (COMPLETE)
UnifiedContextManager now implements IContextInjector:
- ✅ `inject_context(briefing, role, environment)`
- ✅ `create_workspace(session_name, agent_name)`
- ✅ `sanitize_briefing(briefing)`

### Phase 4: DI Integration (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Created `implementations/context_injector.py`
- ✅ Registered in DependencyContainer
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

## Clean Architecture Achieved
