# v1.1 Technical Debt Reduction Plan
## Priority: Context Manager Consolidation

### IMMEDIATE (v1.1 Sprint 1)

#### 1. **Context Manager Consolidation** ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY
**Current State:** 3 separate managers
- `UnifiedContextManager` (primary)
- `ContextManager` (legacy)
- `AgentContextManager` (specialized)

**Target State:** Single unified manager
```python
# Consolidation approach:
1. Audit all three managers for unique features
2. Merge functionality into UnifiedContextManager
3. Create compatibility layer for legacy calls
4. Deprecate old managers with warnings
5. Remove in v1.2
```

**Files to Update:**
- `context_manager.py` â†’ Deprecate
- `agent_context_manager.py` â†’ Merge into unified
- `unified_context_manager.py` â†’ Enhance with merged features

### Sprint 1 Tasks (Week 1-2)

#### Code Cleanup
- [ ] Remove 55 unused imports (2 hours)
- [ ] Fix 24 f-string placeholders (1 hour)
- [ ] Resolve 10 line length issues (30 mins)

#### Testing
- [ ] Fix 11 failing security tests (4 hours)
- [ ] Increase coverage 49% â†’ 70% (8 hours)
- [ ] Add context manager migration tests (2 hours)

#### Dependencies
- [ ] Update 6 outdated packages (1 hour)
- [ ] Add pip-audit to CI pipeline (2 hours)

### Sprint 2 Tasks (Week 3-4)

#### Refactoring
- [ ] Reduce complexity in 5 C901 functions (6 hours)
- [ ] Extract common patterns to utilities (4 hours)
- [ ] Standardize error handling patterns (3 hours)

#### Documentation
- [ ] API documentation for public methods (4 hours)
- [ ] Migration guide for context managers (2 hours)
- [ ] Update architecture diagrams (2 hours)

### Automation Improvements

#### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# .github/workflows/quality.yml
name: Code Quality
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  lint:
    - flake8 --max-complexity=10
    - mypy --strict
  test:
    - pytest --cov=. --cov-fail-under=70
  security:
    - pip-audit
    - bandit -r .
```

### Success Metrics
- âœ… Single context manager
- âœ… 70% test coverage
- âœ… 0 critical linting issues
- âœ… All dependencies current
- âœ… CI/CD pipeline active

### v1.2 Preview
- Remove deprecated managers
- Performance profiling
- Memory optimization
- Enhanced observability
