## 🤖 Your AI Team

When you run `ai-team`, you get:

1. **Orchestrator** (Window 0) - That's you! Coordinates the team
2. **Alex** (Window 1) - Perfectionist architect, quality-focused
3. **Morgan** (Window 2) - Pragmatic shipper, speed-focused

## 📚 Documentation

- **[README_AI_TEAM.md](README_AI_TEAM.md)** - Project overview and quick start
- **[AI_TEAM_USAGE.md](AI_TEAM_USAGE.md)** - Detailed usage guide

## 🎭 What Makes This Special

These aren't typical agreeable AI assistants - they have strong, opposing engineering philosophies:

- **Alex** will argue for proper testing, clean architecture, and long-term thinking
- **Morgan** will push for MVPs, rapid iteration, and shipping quickly
- **You** (the orchestrator) mediate and make final decisions

This creates authentic engineering discussions that help you think through problems from multiple perspectives.
