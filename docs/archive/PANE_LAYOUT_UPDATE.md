# ✅ AI Team CLI - Updated to Use Panes!

## 🔄 Major Update: Windows → Panes

The AI Team CLI has been completely updated to use **tmux panes** instead of separate windows, creating a much better user experience.

## 🏗️ New Pane Layout

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│         Orchestrator            │ <- You (pane 0.0)
├─────────────┬───────────────────┤
│    Alex     │      Morgan       │
│ (pane 0.1)  │   (pane 0.2)      │
└─────────────┴───────────────────┘
```

## 🎯 Benefits of Pane Layout

### **Improved Visibility**
- See all agents simultaneously
- No more switching between windows
- Watch conversations unfold in real-time
- Better overview of team dynamics

### **Easier Navigation**
- `Ctrl+B, ↑` - Move to orchestrator
- `Ctrl+B, ↓` - Move to agents
- `Ctrl+B, ←/→` - Move between Alex and Morgan
- Natural arrow key movement

### **Better Communication**
- Visual context of all agents
- Easy to see who's responding
- Natural conversation flow
- Orchestrator can moderate more effectively

## 📋 Updated Commands

### **Creating Teams**
```bash
ai-team                    # Same command, better layout!
ai-team -s my-project      # Custom session name
```

### **Messaging Agents**
```bash
# Message Alex (top-right pane)
send-claude-message.sh ai-team:0.1 "Alex, thoughts on this architecture?"

# Message Morgan (bottom-right pane)
send-claude-message.sh ai-team:0.2 "Morgan, what's the MVP version?"

# Check responses
tmux capture-pane -t ai-team:0.1 -p | tail -20
```

### **Navigation**
```bash
# Attach and see all agents at once
tmux attach -t ai-team

# List panes (not windows anymore)
tmux list-panes -t ai-team
```

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### **Pane Creation**
- Single window with 3 panes
- 50/50 horizontal split (Orchestrator top, agents bottom)
- 50/50 vertical split (Alex left, Morgan right)
- Automatic pane titles for clarity

### **Communication Updates**
- All targets now use `session:0.X` format
- Pane 0.0 = Orchestrator
- Pane 0.1 = Alex
- Pane 0.2 = Morgan

### **Orchestrator Briefing**
- Updated with visual pane layout diagram
- Clear pane navigation instructions
- Correct communication examples

## 📖 Updated Documentation

All documentation has been updated:
- **README_AI_TEAM.md** - Shows new pane layout
- **AI_TEAM_USAGE.md** - Updated commands and navigation
- **Install script** - Mentions pane-based design

## 🚀 Ready to Use!

The pane-based layout creates a much more engaging experience:

1. **Start your team**: `ai-team`
2. **Attach to session**: `tmux attach -t ai-team`
3. **See everyone at once**: All agents visible simultaneously
4. **Navigate easily**: Arrow keys to move between panes
5. **Watch debates**: See Alex vs Morgan discussions in real-time

## 🎭 Enhanced Experience

The pane layout makes the agent personalities even more engaging:

- **Real-time debates**: Watch Alex and Morgan disagree in adjacent panes
- **Visual moderation**: Easy for orchestrator to see and respond to conflicts
- **Natural flow**: Conversations feel more like a real team meeting
- **Better context**: All agent responses visible for full context
